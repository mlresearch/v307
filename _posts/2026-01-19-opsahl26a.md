title: 'Hybrid Concept-based Models: Using Concepts to Improve Neural Networks’ Accuracy'
openreview: Np3uIwXltO

abstract: Most datasets used for supervised machine learning consist of a single label
  per data point. However, in cases where more information than just the class label
  is available, would it be possible to train models more efficiently? We introduce
  two novel model architectures, which we call \emph{hybrid concept-based models},
  that train using both class labels and additional information in the dataset referred
  to as \emph{concepts}. In order to thoroughly assess their performance, we introduce
  \emph{ConceptShapes}, an open and flexible class of datasets with concept labels.
  We show that the hybrid concept-based models can outperform standard computer vision
  models and previously proposed concept-based models with respect to accuracy. We
  also introduce an algorithm for performing \emph{adversarial concept attacks}, where
  an image is perturbed in a way that does not change a concept-based model’s concept
  predictions, but changes the class prediction. The existence of such adversarial
  examples raises questions about the interpretable qualities promised by concept-based
  models.
