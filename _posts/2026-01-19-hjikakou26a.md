title: On the Generalisation of Koopman Representations for Chaotic System Control
openreview: hbzpEmhMvx
software: https://github.com/kikisprdx/koopman-gen-training
abstract: 'This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
  for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across prediction
  and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose a three-stage
  methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding, pre-training a transformer
  on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for safety-critical control. Our results
  show that Koopman embeddings outperform both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines,
  achieving accurate and data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained
  transformer weights during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating
  that the learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
  task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
  a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning.'
