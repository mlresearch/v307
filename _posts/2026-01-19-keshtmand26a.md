title: Counterfactual generation for Out-of-Distribution data
openreview: ntlTZh2Imr
abstract: Deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications necessitates
  both reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and interpretable model behavior.
  While substantial progress has been made in OOD detection and explainable AI (XAI),
  the question of why a model classifies a data point as OOD remains underexplored.
  Counterfactual explanations are a widely used XAI approach, yet they often fail
  in OOD contexts, as the generated examples may themselves be OOD. To address this
  limitation, we introduce the concept of OOD counterfactuals perturbed inputs that
  transition between distinct OOD categories to provide insight into the model s OOD
  classification decisions. We propose a novel method for generating OOD counterfactuals
  and evaluate it on synthetic, tabular, and image datasets. Empirical results demonstrate
  that our approach offers both quantitatively and qualitatively improved explanations
  compared to existing baselines.
