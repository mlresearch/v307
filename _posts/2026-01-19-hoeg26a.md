title: 'MTVNet: Multi-Contextual Transformers for Volumes – Network for Super-Resolution
  with Long-Range Interactions'
openreview: XVcAe5V5bW
software: https://github.com/AugustHoeg/MTVNet
abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based models have led to significant improvements
  in 2D image super-resolution. However, leveraging these advances for volumetric
  super-resolution remains challenging due to the high memory demands of self-attention
  mechanisms in 3D volumes, which severely limit the receptive field. As a result,
  long-range interactions, one of the key strengths of transformers, are underutilized
  in 3D super-resolution. To investigate this, we propose MTVNet, a volumetric transformer
  model that leverages information from expanded contextual regions at multiple resolution
  scales. Here, coarse resolution information from boarder context regions is carried
  on to inform the super-resolution prediction of a smaller area. Using transformer
  layers at each resolution, our coarse-to-fine modeling limits the number of tokens
  at each scale and enables attention over larger regions than previously possible.
  We compare our method, MTVNet, against state-of-the-art models on five 3D datasets.
  Our results show that expanding the receptive field of transformer-based methods
  yields significant performance gains on high-resolution 3D data. While CNNs outperform
  transformers on low-resolution data, transformer-based methods excel on high-resolution
  volumes with exploitable long-range dependencies, with our MTVNet achieving state-of-the-art
  performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/AugustHoeg/MTVNet.
