title: 'HetGSMOTE: Oversampling for Heterogeneous Graphs'
openreview: rLzas2xQGs

abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective for learning from graph
  structured data, with heterogeneous graphs (HetGs) gaining particular prominence
  for their ability to model diverse real world systems through multiple node and
  edge types. However, class imbalance where certain node classes are significantly
  underrepresented presents a critical challenge for node classification tasks on
  HetGs, as traditional learning approaches fail to adequately handle minority classes.
  This work introduces HetGSMOTE, a novel oversampling framework that extends SMOTE-based
  techniques to heterogeneous graph settings by systematically incorporating node-type,
  edge-type, and metapath information into the synthetic sample generation process.
  HetGSMOTE operates by constructing a content-aggregated and neighbor-type-aggregated
  embedding space through a base model, then generating synthetic minority nodes while
  training specialized edge generators for each node type to preserve essential relational
  structures. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
  and base models, we demonstrate that HetGSMOTE consistently outperforms existing
  baseline methods, achieving substantial improvements in classification performance
  under various imbalance scenarios, particularly in extreme imbalance cases while
  maintaining broad compatibility across different heterogeneous graph neural network
  architectures. We release our code and data preparations at [github.com/smlab-niser/hetgsmote](https://github.com/smlab-niser/hetgsmote).
