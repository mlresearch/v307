title: Improving Vision Model Robustness against Misclassification and Uncertainty
  Attacks via Underconfidence Adversarial Training
openreview: 3upHbaUyR4
abstract: 'Adversarial robustness research has focused on defending against misclassification
  attacks. However, such adversarially trained models remain vulnerable to underconfidence
  adversarial attacks, which reduce the model s confidence without changing the predicted
  class. Decreased confidence can result in unnecessary interventions, delayed diagnoses,
  and a weakening of trust in automated systems. In this work, we introduce two novel
  underconfidence attacks: one that induces ambiguity between a class pair, and ConfSmooth
  which spreads uncertainty across all classes. For defense, we propose Underconfidence
  Adversarial Training (UAT) that embeds our underconfidence attacks in an adversarial
  training framework. We extensively benchmark our underconfidence attacks and defense
  strategies across six model architectures (both CNN and ViT-based), and seven datasets
  (MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, MSTAR and medical imaging).  In 14 of the 15 data-architecture
  combinations, our attack outperforms the state-of-the-art, often substantially.
  Our UAT defense maintains the highest robustness against all underconfidence attacks
  on CIFAR-10, and achieves comparable to or better robustness than adversarial training
  against misclassification attacks while taking half of the gradient steps. By broadening
  the scope of adversarial robustness to include uncertainty-aware threats and defenses,
  UAT enables more robust computer vision systems.'
