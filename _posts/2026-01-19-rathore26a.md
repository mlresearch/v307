title: EEG Guided Token Selection in VQ for Visual Brain Decoding
openreview: E0KjGR4WIs
abstract: "Reconstructing visual stimuli from non-invasive Electroencephalography
  (EEG) is an interesting but challenging task in brain decoding that involves translating
  noisy neural signals into images via fine-grained generative control. In this work,
  we introduce a novel and efficient framework that guides a visual token generator
  by conditioning the generation process on a high-level semantic understanding of
  the EEG signal. Our method leverages a pre-trained LaBraM-based architecture to
  derive a robust class prediction from the neural data. \r In comparison to recent
  works that involve diffusion models, which require high computational resources
  and long inference times, our approach utilizes a lightweight and efficient token
  generator by building upon the bidirectional, parallel decoding capabilities of
  MaskGIT. This choice of components avoids the high computational requirements typical
  of large-scale diffusion processes. This focus on efficiency makes our approach
  not only easier to train but also more viable for potential real-time BCI applications
  where real-time feedback is crucial. \r The core of our method is a straightforward
  yet powerful two-stage process. First, the  EEG classifier distills the complex
  input signal into a class label. In the second stage, this label serves as a direct
  condition for the pre-trained token generator. The generator, guided by this class
  information, then produces a sequence of discrete latent codes that are semantically
  consistent with the original stimulus. This neurally-guided token sequence is finally
  rendered into a high-fidelity image by a pretrained decoder, completing an efficient
  pathway from brain activity to visual representation"
