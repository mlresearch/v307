title: AI-Enabled Vessels Segmentation Model for Real-Time Laparoscopic Ultrasound
  Imaging
openreview: TGk5TQNh18
abstract: Laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) is essential for assessing the liver during
  laparoscopic liver resections. However, the interpretation of LUS images presents
  significant challenges due to the steep learning curve and image noise. In this
  study, we propose an enhanced U-Net-based neural network with a ResNet18 backbone
  specifically designed for real-time liver vessel segmentation of 2D LUS images.
  Our approach incorporates five preprocessing steps aimed at maximizing the training
  information extracted from the ultrasound sonogram region. The modified U-Net model
  achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.879, demonstrating real-time performance at 40
  frames per second and enabling the development of advanced ultrasound-based surgical
  navigation solutions.
