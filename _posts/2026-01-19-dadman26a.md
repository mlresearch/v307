title: Learning Normal Patterns in Musical Loops
openreview: Pr22XVnMW1
software: https://github.com/dadmaan/music-anomalizer
abstract: We propose an unsupervised framework for analyzing audio patterns in musical
  loops using deep feature extraction and anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods
  limited by fixed input lengths, handcrafted features, or domain constraints, our
  approach combines a pre-trained Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT)
  and Feature Fusion Mechanism (FFM) to generate representations from variable-length
  audio. These embeddings are analyzed by Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep
  SVDD), which models normative patterns in a compact latent space. Experiments on
  bass and guitar datasets show our Deep SVDD models—especially with residual autoencoders—outperform
  baselines like Isolation Forest and PCA, achieving better anomaly separation. Our
  work provides a flexible, unsupervised method for effective pattern discovery in
  diverse audio samples.
