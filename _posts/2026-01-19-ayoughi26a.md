title: 'How PARTs assemble into wholes: Learning the relative composition of images'
openreview: QbuKvsQ2BE
software: https://github.com/Melika-Ayoughi/PART
abstract: The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object positional
  relationships, provides a rich source of information for representation learning.
  Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively explored in self-supervised
  learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid structure, where the goal of
  the pretext task involves predicting the absolute position index of patches within
  a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches fall short of capturing the fluid and
  continuous nature of real-world object compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised
  learning approach that leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid
  patches to overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other
  in a continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images an off-grid
  structural relative positioning that is less tied to absolute appearance and can
  remain coherent under variations such as partial visibility or stylistic changes.
  In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object detection and time
  series prediction, PART outperforms grid-based methods like MAE and DropPos, while
  maintaining competitive performance on global classification tasks. By breaking
  free from grid constraints, PART opens up a new trajectory for universal self-supervised
  pretraining across diverse datatypes from images to EEG signals with potential in
  medical imaging, video, and audio.
