title: 'CID: Measuring Feature Importance Through Counterfactual Distributions'
openreview: O1hGYdFm7K
abstract: "Assessing the importance of individual features in Machine Learning is
  critical to understand the model’s decision-making process. While numerous methods
  exist, the lack of a definitive ground truth for comparison highlights the need
  for alternative, well-founded measures.\r This paper introduces a novel post-hoc
  local feature importance method called Counterfactual Importance Distribution (CID).
  We generate two sets of positive and negative counterfactuals, model their distributions
  using Kernel Density Estimation, and rank features based on a distributional dissimilarity
  measure. This measure, grounded in a rigorous mathematical framework, satisfies
  key properties required to function as a valid metric. We showcase the effectiveness
  of our method by comparing with well-established local feature importance explainers.
  Our method not only offers complementary perspectives to existing approaches, but
  also improves performance on faithfulness metrics (both for comprehensiveness and
  sufficiency), resulting in more faithful explanations of the system. These results
  highlight its potential as a valuable tool for model analysis."
