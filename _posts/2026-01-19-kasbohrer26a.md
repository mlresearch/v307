title: Assessing Explanation Fragility of SHAP using Counterfactuals
openreview: 44vMSJUmTi
abstract: 'Post-hoc explanations such as SHAP are increasingly used to justify machine
  learning predictions. Yet, these explanations can be fragile: small, realistic input
  perturbations can cause large shifts in the importance of attributed features. We
  present a multi-seed, distance-controlled *stability assessment* for SHAP-based
  model explanations. For each data instance, we use DiCE to generate plausible counterfactuals,
  pool across random seeds, deduplicate, and retain the $K$ nearest counterfactuals.
  Using a shared independent masker and the model s logit (raw margin), we measure
  per-feature attribution shifts and summarise instance-level instability. On four
  tabular fairness benchmark datasets, we apply our protocol to a logistic regression,
  a multilayer perceptron, and decision trees, including boosted and bagged versions.
  We report within-model group-wise explanation stability and examine which features
  most often drive the observed shifts. To contextualise our findings, we additionally
  report coverage, effective-$K$, distance-to-boundary, and outlier diagnostics. The
  protocol is model-agnostic yet practical for deep networks (batched inference, shared
  background), turning explanation variability into an actionable fairness assessment
  without altering trained models.'
