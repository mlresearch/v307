title: Predicting Calving Events in Antarctica using Machine Learning
openreview: N5Y1FoRfiY
abstract: "Monitoring the calving dynamics of the Antarctic ice shelves is central
  to\r understanding a major driver for the changes to ocean levels on our planet.\r
  Several physical models have been proposed as calving laws, with varying\r predictive
  power. We propose an approach using Machine Learning (ML) to identify key\r variables
  and parameters that may be used in future models of the ice shelf\r calving dynamics.\r
  As part of an ongoing project, we have trained\r a U-Net on samples from a set of
  Gaussian Random Field-represented Essential Climate Variables (ECV).\r Ablation
  studies establish a few of the selected variables as having high\r correlation with
  calving events, with an F1 score above 0.9.\r Our first study site was the Larsen
  C Ice Shelf, on the northwest part of\r the Weddell Sea, where in 2017 there was
  a massive calving event. We have found\r strong correlations between the calving
  and the ice velocity leading up to this\r event, which may be further improved when
  accounting for basal melt rates in the\r area."
