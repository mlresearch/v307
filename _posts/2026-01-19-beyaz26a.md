title: Self-Supervised and Unsupervised Multispectral Anomaly Detection for Unknown
  Substance and Surface Defect Identification
openreview: xFMoxTu1Te
abstract: 'Autonomous systems and environmental monitoring require reliable detection
  of unknown hazardous materials to prevent traffic accidents and ecological damage
  resulting from chemical spills, fuel leaks, and agricultural runoff. Traditional
  detection methods, such as gas chromatography, pose contamination risks and cause
  delays, while laser-based techniques rely on prior localization of potential hotspots.
  This paper addresses the automatic detection of unknown materials (e.g., fertilizer,
  sand, soil) and surface anomalies (e.g., cracks, holes) without requiring labeled
  anomaly examples during training. We employ unsupervised and self-supervised deep
  learning methods to learn normal patterns and identify deviations. Our approach
  evaluates four models: convolutional and vision transformer-based autoencoders,
  and two self-supervised methods, SimCLR and Barlow Twins. Experiments conducted
  on multispectral road images from the German Aerospace Center and the MVTec hazelnut
  dataset demonstrate that the ViT-based autoencoder outperforms its convolutional
  counterpart, while Barlow Twins achieves superior anomaly localization compared
  to SimCLR. These results highlight the potential of efficient deep learning models
  for enhancing road safety and environmental protection through early detection of
  potentially hazardous substances before they cause harm.'
