title: Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks for Cross-Domain Time-Series Modeling in Health
  and Activity Monitoring
openreview: ORr6j65FbA
abstract: Time-series data from wearable sensors and clinical assessments provide
  complementary perspectives on human health, yet they often remain siloed across
  domains. This work presents a framework for harmonizing heterogeneous time-series
  sources at both minute and daily resolutions, extracting interpretable temporal
  features through techniques such as frequency-domain analysis and automated feature
  engineering. On top of this feature space, we benchmark conventional machine learning
  methods, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and a Transformer
  baseline against a proposed Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) model, which adaptively
  learn functional transformations tailored to complex temporal patterns. We evaluate
  models on tasks including activity index prediction and disorder-related classification,
  with a focus on transfer learning across lifestyle and clinical domains. Results
  indicate that KANs achieve competitive performance and offer greater interpretability
  of temporal dynamics than black-box architectures. The proposed framework demonstrates
  how modern time-series models can enable cross-domain learning and improve the understanding
  of physiological and behavioral health patterns.
