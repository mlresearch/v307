abstract: 'Accurate molecular property prediction is a key challenge in fields such
  as drug discovery and materials science, where deep learning models offer promising
  solutions. However, the widespread use of these models is hindered by their lack
  of transparency and the difficulty in assessing the reliability of their predictions.
  In this study, we address these issues by integrating uncertainty quantification
  and explainable AI techniques to enhance the trustworthiness of graph neural networks
  for molecular property prediction. We focus on predicting two distinct properties:
  aqueous solubility and mutagenicity. By deriving explanations in the form of substructure
  attribution scores, we obtain interpretable explanations that signify which chemically
  meaningful substructures influence the model’s predictions. We incorporate uncertainty
  quantification to evaluate the confidence of both the predictions and their explanations.
  Our results demonstrate that predictive uncertainty scores correlate with the accuracy
  of the predictions for both tasks. Uncertainties in the explanations also correlate
  with prediction correctness, and there is a weak to moderate correlation between
  the uncertainties in the predictions and those in the explanations. These findings
  highlight the potential of combining uncertainty quantification and explainability
  to improve the trustworthiness of molecular property prediction models.'
