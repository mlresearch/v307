title: Towards clinical application of liver, vessel, and tumor segmentation using
  partially labeled data
openreview: gys1CGbZ93
abstract: 'Accurate delineation of liver parenchyma, intrahepatic vessels, and tumors
  (LVT) may aid earlier tumor detection, consistent response assessment, and surgical
  planning for patients with liver cancer. Deep learning (DL) may enable such automated
  delineation, but available CT datasets are inconsistent and partially labeled, making
  them unsuited for end-to-end training. We investigate a single-head, 3D segmentation
  framework that learns from partially labeled data by: (i) loss masking per class
  or voxel to ignore missing annotations, (ii) using multi-hot targets and the anatomical
  hierarchy inherent to liver, vessels, and tumors, to handle overlapping structures
  without class competition. In controlled ablations that simulate partial-label training,
  this multi-label masked strategy reliably outperforms masked multi-class baselines,
  avoids precision collapse, and improves tumor overlap and lesion detection sensitivity.
  Scaling training to multiple partially labeled datasets, the model surpasses full-resolution
  nnU-Net on an external clinical cohort, with higher tumor and vessel segmentation
  performance. We conduct a retrospective feasibility analysis on clinical data to
  illustrate the clinical potential of the LVT application. We find that LVT models
  may facilitate earlier detection of metastasis, longitudinal size tracking aligned
  with radiologist measurements, 3D tumor–vessel visualization for surgical planning,
  and stable inter-phase liver volumetry ($\approx$ 5% deviation). These results show
  that multi-label masked learning enables robust, clinically relevant LVT segmentation
  from partially labeled datasets.'
