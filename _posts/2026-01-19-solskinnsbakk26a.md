title: Reducing Manual Workload in SAR-Based Oil Spill Detection Through Uncertainty-Aware
  Deep Learning
openreview: 8wgwRsfTuH
abstract: Constant monitoring of the oceans is required to detect oil spills and reduce
  environmental damage associated with spills. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging
  is a critical tool for oil spill detection, but is complex and requires time-consuming
  manual labor for analysis. Deep learning has shown encouraging performance in automatic
  classification of oil spills on these images, but the performance is still not sufficient
  for a deep learning classifier to act autonomously, making manual assessment essential.
  However, if only a reduced subset of uncertain samples had to be analyzed by human
  experts while the remaining samples could be automatically classified, it could
  greatly reduce the manual workload. In this study, we investigate if uncertainty
  estimates can identify which samples should be prioritized for manual inspection.
  Specifically, we propose a pipeline of defining a user-specified error tolerance
  and identifying an uncertainty threshold that filters out samples for automatic/manual
  thresholding. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on challenging real-world data.
  The results show that our proposed uncertainty-based ranking technique can reduce
  the manual workload by 41%, paving the way for new and more efficient ways to detect
  marine oil spills.
