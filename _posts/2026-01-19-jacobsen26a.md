title: 'Staying on the Manifold: Geometry-Aware Noise Injection'
openreview: GRk65sJxpn
software: https://github.com/albertkjoller/geometric-ml
abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly regularises
  the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and enhancing generalisation.
  However, previous research mostly considered the addition of ambient noise in the
  input space, without considering the underlying structure of the data. In this work,
  we propose several strategies of adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts
  for the lower dimensional manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting
  ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step,
  the noise sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We
  also consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold.
  We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalisation and robustness
  to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while performing at least
  as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our proposed framework extends
  to data manifolds approximated by generative models and we observe similar trends
  on the MNIST digits dataset.
