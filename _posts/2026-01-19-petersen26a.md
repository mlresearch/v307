title: Design and Evaluation of a Geometric Algebra-Based Graph Neural Network for
  Molecular Property Prediction
openreview: aHHQByxsjB
software: https://github.com/khelverskovp/GA-GNN
abstract: Geometric Algebra (GA) provides a unified framework for representing scalars,
  vectors, and higher-dimensional geometric elements, along with the geometric product,
  an operation that mixes information across these components in an equivariant manner.
  While GA has recently attracted attention in deep learning, its potential for molecular
  property prediction remains underexplored. We introduce GA-GNN, a novel equivariant
  graph neural network that extends message passing architectures from separate scalar
  and vector features to multivector representations, and employs sequences of geometric
  product layers as the core update mechanism. Evaluated on the QM9 benchmark, GA-GNN
  achieves competitive performance with the recent state-of-the-art while demonstrating
  that GA-based representations can simplify architecture design. These results highlight
  the potential of GA for building expressive equivariant message passing networks
  for molecular property prediction.
