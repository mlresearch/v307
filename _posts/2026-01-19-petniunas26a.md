title: 'RAG in the Aerospace Domain: A Comprehensive Retrieval, Generation, and User
  Evaluation for NASA Documentation'

abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
  Natural Language Understanding  and text generation, but their application is often
  limited by hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and lack of evidence. Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation (RAG) addresses these fundamental LLM limitations by integrating external
  knowledge sources, thereby improving the factual accuracy and traceability while
  maintaining the text generative capabilities. This work presents the design and
  implementation of a web-based RAG system for the aerospace domain, leveraging more
  than 10,000 NASA technical documents and lessons-learned mission reports. The system
  integrates open-source LLaMA and closed-source OpenAI models and performs an extensive
  comparative analysis of their performance within the RAG framework. Evaluation through
  both automated metrics and user studies demonstrates the effectiveness of the RAG
  approach for both technical and non-technical users. The findings provide insights
  and establish a foundation for future advancements in AI-driven knowledge management
  for specialized fields
