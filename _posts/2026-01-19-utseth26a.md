title: 'Comparing Foundation Models for Medical Images: A Study on Limited Data and
  Generalization'
openreview: V1aCgqLTeY
abstract: "In this study we have investigated how vision foundation models, pretrained
  on different domains, compete with a specialized model for classification as a function
  of the size of the labeled training set of medical images. Furthermore, we have
  looked into the different models’ ability to generalize to difficult cases.\r Our
  experiments are conducted for cardiac ultrasound images and the downstream task
  of view recognition. Still, this classification task is meant to serve as a demonstrative
  example, where we think that the findings should be transferable to other classification
  tasks and other domains. \r Through these experiments we found that the foundation
  models were able to beat the performance of our task-specific supervised model when
  labelled training data were limited. This was true even for models trained on natural
  images and when using the simple linear probing method to create a classifier. We
  observed that more domain-specific foundation models achieved an even higher performance
  with limited data. On the other hand, the more general models showed a greater ability
  to generalize and perform well on difficult, out-of-distribution cases. Still, for
  typical in-domain cases with sufficient labeled data, a task-specific ResNet model
  was competitive with the foundation models, while also being both smaller and faster."
