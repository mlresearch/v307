title: Using Ensemble Diffusion to Estimate Uncertainty for End-to-End Autonomous
  Driving
openreview: 7o4nocapUr
abstract: "End-to-end planning systems for autonomous driving are rapidly improving,
  especially in closed-loop simulation environments like CARLA. Many such driving
  systems either do not consider uncertainty as part of the plan itself or obtain
  it by using specialized representations that do not generalize. In this paper, we
  propose EnDfuser, an end-to-end driving system that uses a diffusion model as the
  trajectory planner. \r EnDfuser effectively leverages complex perception information
  like fused camera and LiDAR features, through combining attention pooling and trajectory
  planning into a single diffusion transformer module. \r Instead of committing to
  a single plan,  EnDfuser produces a distribution of candidate trajectories (128
  for our case) from a single perception frame through ensemble diffusion. \r By observing
  the full set of candidate trajectories, EnDfuser provides interpretability for uncertain,
  multimodal future trajectory spaces.\r Using this information we design a simplistic
  safety-rule that improves the system’s driving score by 1.7% on the LAV benchmark.\r
  Our findings suggest that ensemble diffusion, used as a drop-in replacement for
  traditional point-estimate trajectory planning modules, can contribute to an uncertainty-aware
  decision making process in End-to-End driving policies\r by modeling the uncertainty
  of the posterior trajectory distribution."
