title: Towards Visual Re-Identification of Fish using Fine-Grained Classification
  for Electronic Monitoring in Fisheries

abstract: 'Accurate fisheries data are crucial for effective and sustainable marine
  resource management. With the recent adoption of Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems,
  more video data is now being collected than can be feasibly reviewed manually. This
  paper addresses this challenge by developing an optimized deep learning pipeline
  for automated fish re-identification (Re-ID) using the novel AutoFish dataset, which
  simulates EM systems with conveyor belts with six similarly looking fish species.
  We demonstrate that key Re-ID metrics (R1 and mAP@k) are substantially improved
  by using hard triplet mining in conjunction with a custom image transformation pipeline
  that includes dataset-specific normalization. By employing these strategies, we
  demonstrate that the Vision Transformer-based Swin-T architecture consistently outperforms
  the Convolutional Neural Network-based ResNet-50, achieving peak performance of
  41.65% mAP@k and 90.43% Rank-1 accuracy. An in-depth analysis reveals that the primary
  challenge is distinguishing visually similar individuals of the same species (Intra-species
  errors), where viewpoint inconsistency proves significantly more detrimental than
  partial occlusion. The source code and documentation are available at: \url{https://github.com/msamdk/Fish_Re_Identification.git}'
