title: Unreliable Monte Carlo Dropout Uncertainty Estimation
openreview: zfd7OEUG0o

abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is crucial for machine learning models,
  especially in safety-critical domains. While exact Bayesian inference offers a principled
  approach, it is often computationally infeasible for deep neural networks. Monte
  Carlo dropout (MCD) was proposed as an efficient approximation to Bayesian inference
  in deep learning by applying dropout at inference time. Hence, the method generates
  multiple sub-models yielding a distribution of predictions to estimate uncertainty.
  We investigate its ability to capture true uncertainty and compare to Gaussian Processes
  (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). We find that MCD struggles to accurately
  reflect the underlying true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased
  uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions observed in Bayesian models.
  The findings suggest that uncertainty estimates from MCD, as implemented and evaluated
  in these experiments, may not be as reliable as those from traditional Bayesian
  approaches for capturing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.
