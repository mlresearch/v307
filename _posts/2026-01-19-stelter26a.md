title: Preserving Ordinality in Diabetic Retinopathy Grading through a Distribution-Based
  Loss Function
openreview: TFQYxIUglD
software: https://github.com/Trustworthy-AI-UU-NKI/Ordinal-DR-Grading
abstract: "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a neurovascular complication of diabetes and
  the leading cause of blindness in adults in developed countries. Because DR progresses
  through ordered severity levels, its grading is naturally an ordinal classification
  problem. Yet, most deep learning methods treat it as a categorical task, disregarding
  the inherent class order and worsening performance under class imbalance.\r In this
  work, we introduce a novel ordinal loss function that emphasizes the predictive
  tendencies of the whole model output rather than the class output probabilities
  individually. This design promotes unimodal predictions aligned with the underlying
  severity scale and is particularly robust to class imbalance. To place our method
  in context, we also evaluate a range of existing ordinal approaches on five publicly
  available DR datasets. with cross-entropy serving as a nominal baseline. \r Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that our proposed loss function consistently preserves the
  ordinal structure of DR grades, even under severe imbalance, outperforming both
  nominal and alternative ordinal formulations.\r Code will be released upon acceptance."
