title: 'SimGroupAttn: Similarity-Guided Group Attention for Vision Transformer to
  Incorporate Population Information in Plant Disease Detection'
openreview: 9TLLdpCeX0
abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Vision Transformer (ViT) models
  being limited to intra-image attention, which prevents them from leveraging cross-sample
  information. This is highly relevant in agricultural data such as plant disease
  detection, an important challenge in agriculture where early and reliable diagnosis
  helps protect yields and food security. Yet existing methods often fail to capture
  subtle or overlapping symptoms that only become evident when considered in a population
  context. Our approach $\textit{SimGroupAttn}$ extends masked image modeling by enabling
  image patches to attend not only within their own image but also to similar regions
  across other images in the same batch. Guided by cosine similarity score which is
  trained jointly with model weights,$\textit{SimGroupAttn}$ incorporates population-level
  context into the learned representations, making them more robust and discriminative.
  Extensive experiments on PlantPathology dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms
  Simple Masked Image Modeling (SimMIM) and Masked Autoencoders (MAE) in linear probing
  and classification task. It improves top-1 accuracy by up to 6.5% in linear probing
  for complex classes and 3.5% in classification compared with the best baseline model
  performance under the same settings.
