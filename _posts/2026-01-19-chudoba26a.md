title: Reflective Agents for Knowledge Graph Traversal
openreview: LGUIspPaxb
abstract: Current research on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Knowledge Graphs
  often relies on graph pruning to manage the scale of the data. This approach is
  not feasible for dense, highly structured environments like rigid ontologies, where
  every node has significant interconnected value. The sheer size of these graphs
  inhibits the effectiveness of standard semantic retrieval methods. To overcome this
  limitation, we introduce a novel approach using an autonomous agent that dynamically
  traverses the graph to retrieve information. A key contribution of our work is the
  integration of a feedback mechanism that informs the agent about its general performance
  and specific tool utilization, thereby enhancing its traversal efficiency. We validate
  our method through a systematic study on ontologies of varying sizes, employing
  a user simulator to generate realistic tasks for knowledge graph construction and
  querying. Our findings demonstrate the current problems with information retrieval
  in large, non prunable knowledge structures.
