title: 'Wildfire Spread Scenarios: Increasing Sample Diversity of Segmentation Diffusion
  Models with Training-Free Methods'
openreview: E44d5hzEV0
software: https://github.com/SebastianGer/wildfire-spread-scenarios
abstract: Predicting future states in uncertain environments, such as wildfire spread,
  medical diagnosis, or autonomous driving, requires models that can consider multiple
  plausible outcomes. While diffusion models can effectively learn such multi-modal
  distributions, naively sampling from these models is computationally inefficient,
  potentially requiring hundreds of samples to find low-probability modes that may
  still be operationally relevant. In this work, we address the challenge of sample-efficient
  ambiguous segmentation by evaluating several training-free sampling methods that
  encourage diverse predictions. We adapt two techniques, particle guidance and SPELL,
  originally designed for the generation of diverse natural images, to discrete segmentation
  tasks, and additionally propose a simple clustering-based technique. We validate
  these approaches on the LIDC medical dataset, a modified version of the Cityscapes
  dataset, and MMFire, a new simulation-based wildfire spread dataset introduced in
  this paper. Compared to naive sampling, these approaches increase the HM IoU* metric
  by up to 7.5% on MMFire and 16.4% on Cityscapes, demonstrating that training-free
  methods can be used to efficiently increase the sample diversity of segmentation
  diffusion models with little cost to image quality and runtime.
