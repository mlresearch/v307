title: Investigating the relationship between diversity and generalization in deep
  neural networks
openreview: Khtjo6nLG8
abstract: In ensembles, improved generalization is frequently attributed to \emph{diversity}
  among members of the ensemble. By viewing a single neural network as an \emph{implicit
  ensemble}, we perform an exploratory investigation that applies well-known ensemble
  diversity measures to a neural network in order to study the relationship between
  diversity and generalization in the over-parameterized regime. Our results show
  that i) deeper layers of the network generally have higher levels of diversity—particularly
  for MLPs—and ii) layer-wise accuracy positively correlates with diversity. Additionally,
  we study the effects of well-known regularizers such as Dropout, DropConnect and
  batch size, on diversity and generalization. We generally find that increasing the
  strength of the regularizer increases the diversity in the neural network and this
  increase in diversity is positively correlated with model accuracy. We show that
  these results hold for several benchmark datasets (such as Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10)
  and architectures (MLPs and CNNs). Our findings suggest new avenues of research
  into the generalization ability of deep neural networks.
