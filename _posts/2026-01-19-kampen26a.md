title: Structured Covariance Modeling Using Learned Mixture-of-Bases for Uncertainty
  in 3D Segmentation

abstract: Accurate segmentation is essential in error-critical domains such as medical
  imaging, where outputs support clinical decisions. Probabilistic models like the
  Stochastic Segmentation Network (SSN) enable uncertainty quantification, but existing
  methods typically use low-rank plus diagonal covariance structures that struggle
  to capture both global and local spatial correlations, limiting performance gains
  over deterministic models. We revisit low-rank formulations and introduce two approaches
  - Single-Basis and Mixture-of-Bases decompositions - that project predicted noise
  onto learned covariance bases, either globally or within partitioned volume blocks.
  This yields richer, more flexible uncertainty modeling with minimal parameter overhead.
  On the most challenging organs in the 3D TotalSegmentator CT dataset, our methods
  significantly improve Dice scores over deterministic and baseline stochastic models
  while preserving strong calibration, with the Mixture-of-Bases performing best.
  These findings show that basis-driven covariance modeling can enhance segmentation
  accuracy and uncertainty estimation in 3D medical imaging.
